# This file defines code ownership in VMR.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
#
# <path>/ matches files under <path> and any of its subdirectories unless later match
# <path>/* matches files under <path> but *not* further nested files.
